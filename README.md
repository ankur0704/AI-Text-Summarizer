# üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

A Google AI Studio API Key

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gemini-text-summarizer.git
cd gemini-text-summarizer

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

### Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

### Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

### Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Your API Key
The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

Create a file named .env in the root of your project folder.

Inside the .env file, add your API key in the following format:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIza...YourSecretGoogleApiKey"

Note: The .env file is listed in the .gitignore file, so your secret key will not be committed to GitHub.

5. Run the Application
You are now ready to run the Streamlit application!

streamlit run app.py

A new tab should open in your web browser with the application running.
